This integration allows Home Assistant to control the **status LEDs** on UniFi Access Points (APs), including:

- 🔄 Turning the LED on/off via a `light entity`
- ✴️ Flashing the LED for 2 minutes via a `button entity` 
- ⚙️ Fully configurable via the Home Assistant UI

---

## Requirements
- Home Assistant 2023.1.0 or later (recommended)
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- A **self-hosted** UniFi controller (UDM and Cloud Gateways are not officially supported.)

---

## Installation

- Search for "UniFi AP LED Control" in HACS
- Install **UniFi AP LED Control**
- Restart Home Assistant

---

## Configuration

You will need:
- UniFi Controller IP/hostname
- Username and password (use a local account with no MFA for least risk). If an account has MFA enabled, it will fail.
- Site ID (usually `default`)

---

## Entities

- **Light Entity**: Controls the LED state (on/off) for each AP (e.g., `light.office_ap_led`).
- **Button Entity**: Triggers the `locate` command to flash the AP’s LED for 2 minutes (e.g., `button.office_ap_flash`).

---

## Security

- ⚠️ This integration allows you to disable SSL verification when connecting to the UniFi controller. If you do so, ensure your network is secure and that credentials are protected.
- You should not use your main ui.com account. Create a local account on your Controller for the Integration to use with no MFA enabled.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection errors**: Ensure the controller IP/hostname is correct and reachable. Ensure you are using a self-hosted Unifi Controller, the project needs someone with a UDM to complete support for UDMs and Cloud Gateways.
- **Authentication errors**: Verify the username/password and ensure the account has sufficient permissions, and does **NOT** have MFA enabled.
